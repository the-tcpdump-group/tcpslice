If you have not built libpcap, do so first.  See the README file in
this directory for the ftp location.

You will need an ANSI C compiler to build tcpslice. The configure
script will abort if your compiler is not ANSI compliant. If this
happens, use the GNU C compiler, available via anonymous ftp:

	ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gcc.tar.gz

After libpcap has been built (either install it with "make install" and
"make install-incl" or make sure both the libpcap and tcpslice source
trees are in the same directory), edit the BINDEST and MANDEST paths in
Makefile.in and run ./configure (a shell script).  "configure" will
determine your system attributes and generate an appropriate Makefile
from Makefile.in.  Now build tcpslice by running "make".

If everything builds ok, su and type "make install" (and optionally
"make install-man). This will install tcpslice and the manual entry.

If your system is not one which we have tested tcpslice on, you may
have to modify the configure script and Makefile.in. Please send us
patches for any modifications you need to make.
